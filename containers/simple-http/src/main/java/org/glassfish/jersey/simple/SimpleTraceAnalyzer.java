/**
 * Tracing at a very low level can be performed with a {@link TraceAnalyzer}. This provides much
 * more useful information than the conventional {@link LoggingFilter} in that it provides details
 * at a very low level. This is very useful when monitoring performance interactions at the TCP
 * level between clients and servers.
 * <p/>
 * Performance overhead for the server is minimal as events are pumped out in batches. The amount of
 * logging information will increase quite significantly though.
