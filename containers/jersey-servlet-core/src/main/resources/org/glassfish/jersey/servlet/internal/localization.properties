async.processing.not.supported=Asynchronous processing not supported on Servlet 2.x container.
# {0} - status code; {1} - status reason message
exception.sending.error.response=I/O exception occurred while sending "{0}/{1}" error response.
form.param.consumed=A servlet request to the URI {0} contains form parameters in the request body but the request body has been consumed by the servlet or a servlet filter accessing the request parameters. Only resource methods using @FormParam will work as expected. Resource methods consuming the request body by other means will not work as expected.
init.param.regex.syntax.invalid=The syntax is invalid for the regular expression "{0}" associated with the initialization parameter "{1}".
# {0} - name (e.g. 'BookmarkPU')
persistence.unit.not.configured=Persistence unit "{0}" is not configured as a servlet parameter in web.xml.
# {0} - class name
no.thread.local.value=No thread local value in scope for proxy of {0}.
resource.config.parent.class.invalid=Resource configuration class {0} is not a subclass of {1}.
resource.config.unable.to.load=Resource configuration class {0} could not be loaded.
servlet.path.mismatch=The servlet path {0} does not start with the filter context path {1}.
servlet.request.suspend.failed=Attempt to put servlet request into asynchronous mode has failed. Please check your servlet configuration \
  - all Servlet instances and Servlet filters involved in the request processing must explicitly declare support for asynchronous request processing.
header.value.read.failed=Attempt to read the header value failed.
filter.context.path.missing=The root of the app was not properly defined. Either use a Servlet 3.x container or add \
  an init-param 'jersey.config.servlet.filter.contextPath' to the filter configuration. Due to Servlet 2.x API, Jersey cannot \
  determine the request base URI solely from the ServletContext. The application will most likely not work.
