    <title>Spring DI</title>

    <para>
        Jersey provides an extension to support Spring DI.
        This enables Jersey to use Spring beans as JAX-RS components and also allows Spring to inject into Jersey managed components.
    </para>

    <section>
        <title>Dependencies</title>

        <para>
            If you want to use Jersey Spring DI support
            you will need to add the &jersey-spring3; module into the list of your dependencies:

            <programlisting language="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.jersey.ext&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;jersey-spring3&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;&version;&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
        </para>

        <para>
            The above module does not add any transitive dependency to Spring modules, so you will need to add
            Spring 3 dependencies explicitly into your dependency list.
        </para>

    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Registration and Configuration</title>

        <para>
            To use capabilities of Jersey Spring 3 DI support in your JAX-RS/Jersey application you need to have
            the above mentioned module on your class-path.
        </para>

    </section>
