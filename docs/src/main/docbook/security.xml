        <section>
            <title>SecurityContext</title>
            <para>
                Security information is available by injecting a &jaxrs.core.SecurityContext; instance using &jaxrs.core.Context;
                annotation, that provides essentially the equivalent of the functionality available on
                <link xlink:href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html">HttpServletRequest</link>
                API. The injected security context depends on the actual Jersey application deployment. For example, if a
                Jersey application is deployed in a Servlet container, the Jersey &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext; will return
                information of the security context retrieved from Servlet request. For Jersey applications
                deployed on a Grizzly server, the &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext; will return information retrieved from the
                Grizzly request.
            </para>

            <para>
                &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext; can be used in conjunction with sub-resource locators to return different
                resources if the user principle is included in a certain role. For example, a sub-resource locator could return
                a different resource if a user is a preferred customer:

                <example>
                    <title>Accessing <code>SecurityContext</code></title>
                    <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">@Path("basket")
public ShoppingBasketResource get(@Context SecurityContext sc) {
    if (sc.isUserInRole("PreferredCustomer") {
        return new PreferredCustomerShoppingBasketResource();
    } else {
        return new ShoppingBasketResource();
    }
}</programlisting>
                </example>
            </para>
            <para>
                &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext; can be injected also to singleton resources and
                providers as a class field. In such case the proxy of the request-scoped &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext;
                will be injected.

                <example>
                    <title>Injecting <code>SecurityContext</code> into a singleton resource</title>
                    <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">@Path("resource")
@Singleton
public static class MyResource {
    @Context
    // Jersey will inject proxy of Security Context
    SecurityContext securityContext;

    @GET
    public String getUserPrincipal() {
        return securityContext.getUserPrincipal().getName();
    }
}</programlisting>
                </example>
            </para>

            <section>
                <title>Initialize SecurityContext with Servlets</title>
                <para>
                    As described above, the &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext; by default (if not overwritten by filters)
                    only offers information from an underlying container. In the case you deploy a Jersey application
                    in a Servlet container, you need to setup the <literal>&lt;security-constraint&gt;</literal>,
                    <literal>&lt;auth-constraint&gt;</literal> and user to roles mappings in order to pass correct information
                    to the &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext;.
                </para>
            </section>

            <section>
                <title>SecurityContext in ContainerRequestContext</title>
                <para>
                    The &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext; can be retrieved also from &jaxrs.ContainerRequestContext; via
                    <literal>getSecurityContext()</literal> method. You can also set the &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext; into
                    the request using method <literal>setSecurityContext(SecurityContext)</literal>. If you set a
                    new &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext; in the &jaxrs.container.ContainerRequestFilter; into the
                    &lit.jaxrs.ContainerRequestContext;, then this security context will be used for injections in resource
                    classes (wrapped into the proxy). This way you can implement a custom authentication filter that
                    may setup your own &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext; to be used. To ensure the early execution of your custom
                    authentication request filter, set the filter priority to <literal>AUTHENTICATION</literal> using
                    constants from &jaxrs.Priorities;. An early execution of you authentication filter will ensure that all
                    other filters, resources, resource methods and sub-resource locators will execute with your custom
                    &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext; instance.

                <title>Security resources with <literal>web.xml</literal></title>
                <para>
                    In cases where a Jersey application is deployed in a Servlet container you can rely only on
                    the standard Java EE Web application security mechanisms offered by the Servlet container and
                    configurable via application's <literal>web.xml</literal> descriptor.
                    You need to define the <literal>&lt;security-constraint&gt;</literal> elements in the
                    <literal>web.xml</literal> and assign roles which are able to access these resources. You can also
                    define HTTP methods that are allowed to be executed. See the following example.

                    <example>
                        <title>Injecting <code>SecurityContext</code> into singletons</title>
                        <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">&lt;security-constraint&gt;
    &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/rest/admin/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
    &lt;auth-constraint&gt;
        &lt;role-name&gt;admin&lt;/role-name&gt;
    &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;
&lt;/security-constraint&gt;
&lt;security-constraint&gt;
    &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/rest/orders/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
    &lt;auth-constraint&gt;
        &lt;role-name&gt;customer&lt;/role-name&gt;
    &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;
&lt;/security-constraint&gt;
&lt;login-config&gt;
    &lt;auth-method&gt;BASIC&lt;/auth-method&gt;
    &lt;realm-name&gt;my-defaul-realm&lt;/realm-name&gt;
&lt;/login-config&gt;</programlisting>
                    </example>

                    The example secures two kinds of URI namespaces using the HTTP Basic Authentication.
                    <literal>rest/admin/*</literal> will be accessible only for user group "admin" and
                    <literal>rest/orders/*</literal> will be accessible for "customer" user group. This security configuration
                    does not use JAX-RS or Jersey features at all as it is enforced by the Servlet container even before
                    a request reaches the Jersey application. Keeping this security constrains up to date with your JAX-RS
                    application might not be easy as whenever you change the &jaxrs.Path; annotations on your resource classes
                    you may need to update also the <literal>web.xml</literal> security configurations to reflect the changed
                    JAX-RS resource paths. Therefore Jersey offers a
                    <link linkend="annotation-based-security">more flexible solution</link> based on placing standard Java EE
                    security annotations directly on JAX-RS resource classes and methods.
                </para>

            </section>
            <section xml:id="annotation-based-security">
                <title>Securing JAX-RS resources with annotations</title>

                <para>
                    With Jersey you can define the access to resources based on the user group using annotations. You can for
                    example define that only a user group "admin" can execute specific resource method. To do that you firstly
                    need to register &jersey.server.RolesAllowedDynamicFeature; as a provider. The following example shows how
                    to register the feature if your deployment is based on a &jersey.server.ResourceConfig;.

                    <example>
                        <title>Registering RolesAllowedDynamicFeature using ResourceConfig</title>
                        <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">final ResourceConfig resourceConfig = new ResourceConfig(MyResource.class);
resourceConfig.register(RolesAllowedDynamicFeature.class);</programlisting>
                    </example>
                </para>
                <para>
                    Then you can use annotations from package <literal>javax.annotation.security</literal> defined by JSR-250.
                    See the following example.

                    <example>
                        <title>Injecting <code>SecurityContext</code> into singletons</title>
                        <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">@Path("/")
@PermitAll
public class Resource {
    @RolesAllowed("user")
    @GET
    public String get() { return "GET"; }

    @RolesAllowed("admin")
    @POST
    public String post(String content) { return content; }

    @Path("sub")
    public SubResource getSubResource() {
        return new SubResource();
    }
}</programlisting>
                    </example>

                    The resource class <literal>Resource</literal> defined in the example is annotated with a
                    &jee6.annotations.PermitAll; annotation. This means that all methods in the class which do not this
                    annotation will be permitted for all user groups (no restrictions are defined). In our example, the
                    annotation will only apply to the <literal>getSubResource()</literal> method as it is the only method
                    that does not override the annotation by defining custom role-based security settings using the
                    &jee6.annotations.RolesAllowed; annotation.
                    &lit.jee6.annotations.RolesAllowed; annotation present on other methods defines a role or a set of roles
                    that are allowed to execute a particular method.
                </para>
                <para>
                    These Java EE security annotations are processed internally in the request filter registered using the
                    Jersey &lit.jersey.server.RolesAllowedDynamicFeature;. The roles defined in the annotations are tested against
                    current roles set in the &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext; using
                    the &lit.jaxrs.core.SecurityContext;<literal>.isUserInRole(String role)</literal> method. In case the caller
                    is not in the role specified by the annotation, the HTTP <literal>404</literal> error response is returned.
