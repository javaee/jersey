    <title>Jersey Test Framework</title>

    <para>
        Jersey Test Framework originated as an internal tool used for verifying the correct implementation of
        server-side components. Testing RESTful applications became a more pressing issue with "modern" approaches like
        test-driven development and users started to look for a tool that could help with designing and running
        the tests as fast as possible but with many options related to test execution environment.
    </para>

    <para>
        Current implementation of Jersey Test Framework supports the following set of features:

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>pre-configured client to access deployed application</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>support for multiple containers - grizzly, in-memory, jdk, simple, jetty</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>able to run against any external container</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>automated configurable traffic logging</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        Jersey Test Framework is based on JUnit and works almost out-of-the box. It is easy to integrate it
        within your Maven-based project. While it is usable on all environments where you can run JUnit, we support primarily the
        Maven-based setups.
    </para>

        <title>Basics</title>

        <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">public class SimpleTest extends JerseyTest {

    @Path("hello")
    public static class HelloResource {
        @GET
        public String getHello() {
            return "Hello World!";
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected Application configure() {
        return new ResourceConfig(HelloResource.class);
    }

    @Test
    public void test() {
        final String hello = target("hello").request().get(String.class);
        assertEquals("Hello World!", hello);
    }
}</programlisting>

        <para>
            If you want to develop a test using Jersey Test Framework, you need to subclass &jersey.test.JerseyTest; and
            configure the set of resources and/or providers that will be deployed as part of the test application. This short
            code snippet shows basic resource class <literal>HelloResource</literal> used in tests defined as part of the
            <literal>SimpleTest</literal> class. The overridden <literal>configure</literal> method returns
            a &jersey.server.ResourceConfig; of the test application,that contains only the <literal>HelloResource</literal>
            resource class. &lit.jersey.server.ResourceConfig; is a sub-class of JAX-RS &jaxrs.core.Application;. It is a Jersey
            convenience class for configuring JAX-RS applications. &lit.jersey.server.ResourceConfig; also implements JAX-RS
            &jaxrs.core.Configurable; interface to make the application configuration more flexible.

        <title>Supported Containers</title>

        <para>
            &jersey.test.JerseyTest; supports deploying applications on various containers, all (except the external container
            wrapper) need to have some "glue" code to be supported. Currently Jersey Test Framework provides support for
            Grizzly, In-Memory, JDK (<literal>com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer</literal>), Simple HTTP container
            (<literal>org.simpleframework.http</literal>) and Jetty HTTP container (<literal>org.eclipse.jetty</literal>).
        </para>

        <para>
            A test container is selected based on various inputs.
            <link xlink:href="&jersey.javadoc.path;/test/JerseyTest.html#getTestContainerFactory()">JerseyTest#getTestContainerFactory()</link>
            is always executed, so if you override it and provide your own version of
            &jersey.test.spi.TestContainerFactory;, nothing else will be considered.
            Setting a system variable
            <link xlink:href="&jersey.javadoc.path;/test/TestProperties.html#CONTAINER_FACTORY">TestProperties#CONTAINER_FACTORY</link>
            has similar effect. This way you may defer the decision on which containers you want to run your tests
            from the compile time to the test execution time.
            Default implementation of &lit.jersey.test.spi.TestContainerFactory; looks for container factories on classpath.
            If more than one instance is found and there is a Grizzly test container factory among them, it will be used; if not,
            a warning will be logged and the first found factory will be instantiated.
        </para>

        <para>
            Following is a brief description of all container factories supported in Jersey Test Framework.
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        Jersey provides 2 different test container factories based on Grizzly.
                        The <literal>GrizzlyTestContainerFactory</literal> creates a container that can run as a light-weight,
                        plain HTTP container. Almost all Jersey tests are using Grizzly HTTP test container factory.
                        Second factory is <literal>GrizzlyWebTestContainerFactory</literal> that is Servlet-based and supports
                        Servlet deployment context for tested applications. This factory can be useful when testing more complex
                        Servlet-based application deployments.

                    <para>
                        In-Memory container is not a real container. It starts Jersey application and directly calls internal
                        APIs to handle request created by client provided by test framework. There is no network communication
                        involved. This containers does not support servlet and other container dependent features, but it is
                        a perfect choice for simple unit tests.

        <title>Advanced features</title>

        <section>
            <title>&lit.jersey.test.JerseyTest; Features</title>

            <para>&lit.jersey.test.JerseyTest; provide
                <link xlink:href="&jersey.javadoc.path;/test/JerseyTest.html#enable(java.lang.String)">enable(...)</link>,
                <link xlink:href="&jersey.javadoc.path;/test/JerseyTest.html#forceEnable(java.lang.String)">forceEnable(...)</link>
                and <link xlink:href="&jersey.javadoc.path;/test/JerseyTest.html#disable(java.lang.String)">disable(...)</link>
                methods, that give you control over configuring values of the properties defined and described in the
                &lit.jersey.test.TestProperties; class. A typical code that overrides the default property values is listed
                bellow:

                <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">public class SimpleTest extends JerseyTest {
    // ...

    @Override
    protected Application configure() {
        enable(TestProperties.LOG_TRAFFIC);
        enable(TestProperties.DUMP_ENTITY);

        // ...

    }
}</programlisting>

                The code in the example above enables test traffic logging (inbound and outbound headers) as well as
                dumping the HTTP message entity as part of the traffic logging.
            </para>
        </section>


        <section>
            <title>External container</title>

            <para>
                Complicated test scenarios may require fully started containers with complex setup configuration, that is not
                easily doable with current Jersey container support. To address these use cases, Jersey Test Framework providers
                general fallback mechanism - an External Test Container Factory. Support of this external container "wrapper" is
                provided as the following module:

                <programlisting language="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.jersey.test-framework.providers&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;jersey-test-framework-provider-external&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;&version;&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>

                As indicated, the "container" exposed by this module is just a wrapper or stub, that redirects all request to
                a configured host and port. Writing tests for this container is same as for any other but you have to provide
                the information about host and port during the test execution:

                <screen>mvn test -Djersey.test.host=myhost.org -Djersey.config.test.container.port=8080</screen>
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Test Client configuration</title>

            <para>
                Tests might require some advanced client configuration. This is possible by overriding
                <link xlink:href="&jersey.javadoc.path;/test/JerseyTest.html#configureClient(org.glassfish.jersey.client.ClientConfig)">configureClient(ClientConfig clientConfig)</link>
                method. Typical use case for this is registering more providers, such as &jaxrs.ext.MessageBodyReader;s or
                &jaxrs.ext.MessageBodyWriter;s, or enabling additional features.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Accessing the logged test records programmatically</title>

            <para>
                Sometimes you might need to check a logged message as part of your test assertions. For this purpose Jersey Test
                Framework provides convenient access to the logged records via
                <link xlink:href="&jersey.javadoc.path;/test/JerseyTest.html#getLastLoggedRecord()">JerseyTest#getLastLoggedRecord()</link>
                and
                <link xlink:href="&jersey.javadoc.path;/test/JerseyTest.html#getLoggedRecords()">JerseyTest#getLoggedRecords()</link>
                methods. Note that this feature is not enabled by default, see
                <link xlink:href="&jersey.javadoc.path;/test/TestProperties.html#RECORD_LOG_LEVEL">TestProperties#RECORD_LOG_LEVEL</link>
                for more information.
