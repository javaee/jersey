            This is user guide for Jersey &version;. We are trying to keep it up to date as we add new features.
            When reading the user guide, please consult also our
            <link xlink:href="&jersey.javadoc.root.uri;/index.html">Jersey API documentation</link> as an additional source
            of information about Jersey features and API.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you would like to contribute to the guide or have questions on things not covered in our docs, please
            contact us at<link xlink:href="mailto:users@jersey.java.net">users@jersey.java.net</link>. Similarly,
            in case you spot any errors in the Jersey documentation, please report them by filing a new issue in our
            <link xlink:href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY">Jersey JIRA Issue Tracker</link>
            under
            <literal>docs</literal>
            component. Please make sure to specify the version of the Jersey User Guide where the error has been spotted
            by selecting the proper value for the
            <literal>Affected Version</literal>
            field.

            <para>
                First mention of any Jersey and JAX-RS API component in a section links to the API documentation of the
                referenced component. Any sub-sequent mentions of the component in the same chapter are rendered using a
                <literal>monospaced</literal>
                font.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emphasis>Emphasised font</emphasis>
                is used to a call attention to a newly introduce concept, when it first
                occurs in the text.
            </para>
            <para>
                In some of the code listings, certain lines are too long to be displayed on one line for the available
                page width. In such case, the lines that exceed the available page width are broken up into multiple lines
                using a
                <literal>'\'</literal>
                at the end of each line to indicate that a break has been introduced to
                fit the line in the page. For example:

                <programlisting linenumbering="unnumbered">
This is an overly long line that \
might not fit the available page \
width and had to be broken into \
multiple lines.

This line fits the page width.
                </programlisting>

                Should read as:

                <programlisting linenumbering="unnumbered">
This is an overly long line that might not fit the available page width and had to be broken into multiple lines.

This line fits the page width.
                </programlisting>
            </para>
