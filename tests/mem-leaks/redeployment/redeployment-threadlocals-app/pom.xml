    <description>

        This project shows that not careful use of ThreadLocal in a thread-pool environment is a risk. In this case, memory leaks
        may occur under certain circumstances.

        Known cases when memory leaks do happen:

        [1] Tomcat with deployment by using its admin REST API (copying to webapps dir does not cause a memory leak since the
        initialization of the application is done by a different thread, which might get eventually discarded.)

        [2] Glassfish - probably works due to a fact, that HK2 is not used (as opposed to redeployment-no-jersey-test-app) and the
        classes that participate on strong references to a GC root are loaded by webapp classloader.


        To run this test threadlocals classloader memory leak example, execute from jersey root dir:

        [1] Glassfish: mvn clean install -pl :redeployment-threadlocals-app -P gf4,memleak-leaking-test,memleak-redeployment

        [2] Weblogic: mvn clean install -pl :redeployment-threadlocals-app -P wls,memleak-leaking-test,memleak-redeployment

        [3] Tomcat: mvn clean install -pl :redeployment-threadlocals-app -P tomcat,memleak-leaking-test,memleak-redeployment
