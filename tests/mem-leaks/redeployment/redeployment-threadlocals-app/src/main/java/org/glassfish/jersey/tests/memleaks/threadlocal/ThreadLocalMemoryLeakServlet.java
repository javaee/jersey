 * A servlet that introduces a memory leak with a single call. All the classes loaded by current classloader won't get GCed even
 * after this application is undeployed.
 * <p/>
 * This servlet demonstrates that fix HK2-247 when {@link ThreadLocal} reference is changed from a static to an instance, it does
 * not always solve memory leak issues as long as a static reference (in this case {@link StaticReferenceClass#STATIC_HOLDER})
 * holds (even transitively) the {@link ThreadLocal} instance.
 * <p/>
 * To revert this case to the simple one (the original one), change the {@link #threadLocal} instance should be static and than no
 * {@link StaticReferenceClass#STATIC_HOLDER} is needed. The memory leak occurs without any other special actions.
