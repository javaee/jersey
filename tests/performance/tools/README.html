            </header>

            <p>
                This module contains a simple tool to generate data sets for performance testing. It generates three
                distinct media types: xml, json and plain text, each in a variety of predefined data set sizes (1kB,
                5kB, 10kB, 1MB and optionally 1GB).
            </p>

            <p>
                The generation of the largest files (1GB) is disabled by default to save disk space and shorten the
                generation time. To enable it, change the value of the <pre>GENERATE_ALSO_GIGABYTE_DATASETS</pre>
            constant in the <pre>TestDataGeneratorApp</pre> class to true.
            </p>

            <h2>Running the Example</h2>

            <p>Run the example as follows:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <pre>mvn clean compile exec:java</pre>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                You can tweak the values of several constants in the <pre>TestDataGeneratorApp</pre> class before
            launching the generation. For more information, please see the javadocs.
            The above command launches a Grizzly server with the generation server-side app and runs a client with
            predefined parameters against it.
