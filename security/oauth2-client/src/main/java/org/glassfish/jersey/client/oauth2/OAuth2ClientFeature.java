/**
 * OAuth2 client filter feature registers the support for performing authenticated requests to the
 * Service Provider. The feature does not perform Authorization Flow (see {@link OAuth2CodeGrantFlow}
 * for details how to use Authorization Flow and retrieve Access Token). The feature uses access to initialize
 * the internal {@link javax.ws.rs.container.ContainerRequestFilter filter}
 * which will add {@code Authorization} http header containing OAuth 2 authorization information including (based
 * on {@code bearer} tokens).
 * <p>
 * The internal filter can be controlled by properties put into
 * the {@link javax.ws.rs.client.ClientRequestContext client request}
 * using {@link javax.ws.rs.client.ClientRequestContext#setProperty(String, Object)} method. The property key
 * is defined in this class as a static variables
 * ({@link OAuth2ClientSupport#OAUTH2_PROPERTY_ACCESS_TOKEN} (see its javadoc for usage).
 * Using the property a specific
 * access token can be defined for each request.
 * </p>
 * Example of using specific access token for one request:
 * <pre>
 * final Response response = client.target("foo").request()
 *           .property(OAUTH2_PROPERTY_ACCESS_TOKEN, "6ab45ab465e46f54d771a").get();
