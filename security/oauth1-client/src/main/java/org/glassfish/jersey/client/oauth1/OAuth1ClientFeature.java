/**
 * OAuth1 client filter feature registers the support for performing authenticated requests to the
 * Service Provider. The feature does not perform Authorization Flow (see {@link OAuth1AuthorizationFlow}
 * for details how to use Authorization Flow and retrieve Access Token). The feature uses {@link ConsumerCredentials}
 * and {@link AccessToken} to initialize the internal {@link javax.ws.rs.container.ContainerRequestFilter filter}
 * which will add {@code Authorization} headers containing OAuth authorization information including
 * the oauth signature.
 * <p>
 * The internal filter can be controlled by properties put into
 * the {@link javax.ws.rs.client.ClientRequestContext client request}
 * using {@link javax.ws.rs.client.ClientRequestContext#setProperty(String, Object)} method. The property keys
 * are defined in this class as a static variables (see their javadocs for usage). Using these properties a specific
 * {@link AccessToken} can be defined for each request for example.
 * </p>
 * Example of using specific access token for one request:
 * <pre>
 * final Response response = client.target("foo").request()
 *           .property(OAUTH_PROPERTY_ACCESS_TOKEN, new AccessToken("ab454f84e", "f454de848a54b")).get();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * See {@link OAuth1Builder} for more information of how to build this feature.
