/**
 * The main class to build the support for OAuth 1 into the Jersey client.
 * <p>
 * The support for OAuth is divided into two parts:
 * <list>
 *     <li><b>Authorization Flow:</b> process of acquiring the user
 *     approval for accessing user's resources on the Service Provider. The authorization process is managed
 *     by an implementation of {@link OAuth1AuthorizationFlow} interface. The result of the process is
 *     an {@link AccessToken}.</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Authenticated Requests:</b> requests done by a {@link javax.ws.rs.client.Client client} are
 *     enhanced by an {@code Authorization} http header that contains OAuth1 authorization information
 *     based on the {@code AccessToken} received from Authorization flow. This support is provided by
 *     {@link javax.ws.rs.core.Feature oauth 1 filter feature} that is registered into client configuration.
 *     </li>
 * </list>
 * This class contains static method that allows to build both OAuth1 features (authorization flow and client feature).
 * </p>
