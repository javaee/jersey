/**
 * Provides support for Model, View and Controller (MVC).
 * <p/>
 * Given the MVC pattern the Controller corresponds to a resource class, the View to a template referenced by a template name,
 * and the Model to a Java object (or a Java bean).
 * <p/>
 * A resource method of a resource class may return an instance of {@link org.glassfish.jersey.server.mvc.Viewable} that
 * encapsulates the template name and the model. In this respect the instance of{@link org.glassfish.jersey.server.mvc.Viewable}
 * is the response entity. Such a viewable response entity may be set in contexts other than a resource method but for the
 * purposes of this section the focus is on resource methods.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link org.glassfish.jersey.server.mvc.Viewable}, returned by a resource method,
 * will be processed such that the template name is resolved to a template reference that identifies a template capable of
 * being processed by an appropriate view processor.
 * <br/>
 * The view processor then processes template given the model to produce a response entity that is returned to the client.
 * <p/>
 * For example, the template name could reference a Java Server Page (JSP) and the model will be accessible to that JSP. The
 * JSP view processor will process the JSP resulting in an HTML document that is returned as the response entity. (See later
 * for more details.)
 * <p/>
 * Two forms of returning {@link org.glassfish.jersey.server.mvc.Viewable} instances are supported: explicit; and implicit.
