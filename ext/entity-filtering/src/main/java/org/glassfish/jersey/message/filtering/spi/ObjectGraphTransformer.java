/**
 * This contract brings support for transforming an internal representation of entity data filtering feature into an object
 * familiar to underlying provider (e.g. message body worker).
 * <p>
 * This interface is supposed to be implemented by modules providing JAX-RS/Jersey providers / configuration object (e.g. message
 * body workers) that can directly affect reading/writing of an entity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations should be registered into client/server runtime via
 * {@link AbstractBinder jersey binder} (for more information and common implementation see
 * {@link AbstractObjectProvider}):
 * <pre>
 * bindAsContract(MyObjectGraphTransformer.class)
 *       // FilteringGraphTransformer.
 *       .to(new TypeLiteral&lt;ObjectGraphTransformer&lt;MyFilteringObject&gt;&gt;() {})
 *       // Scope.
 *       .in(Singleton.class);
 * </pre>
 * The custom transformer can be then {@link javax.inject.Inject injected} as one these injection point types:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code MyObjectGraphTransformer}</li>
 * <li>{@code javax.inject.Provider&lt;ObjectGraphTransformer&lt;MyFilteringObject&gt;&gt;}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default a {@code ObjectGraph} -&gt; {@code ObjectGraph} transformer is available in the runtime. This transformer can be
 * injected (via {@link javax.inject.Inject @Inject}) into the following types:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code ObjectGraphTransformer}</li>
 * <li>{@code javax.inject.Provider&lt;ObjectGraphTransformer&lt;Object&gt;&gt;}</li>
 * <li>{@code javax.inject.Provider&lt;ObjectGraphTransformer&lt;ObjectGraph&gt;&gt;}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> representation of entity data filtering requested by provider.
