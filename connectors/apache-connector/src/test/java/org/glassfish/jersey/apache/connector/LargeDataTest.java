/**
 * The LargeDataTest reproduces a problem when bytes of large data sent are incorrectly sent.
 * As a result, the request body is different than what was sent by the client.
 * <p>
 * In order to be able to inspect the request body, the generated data is a sequence of numbers
 * delimited with new lines. Such as
 * <pre><code>
 *     1
 *     2
 *     3
 *
 *     ...
 *
 *     57234
 *     57235
 *     57236
 *
 *     ...
 * </code></pre>
 * It is also possible to send the data to netcat: {@code nc -l 8080} and verify the problem is
 * on the client side.
