            <p>
                To test monitoring JMX MBeans run
                <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html">JConsole</a>
                (type "jconsole" in the command line) and attach to the process of application server
                to which the sample is deployed. If you use Jetty (default option), then connect to the process
                which has jetty in the name (e.g. "org.codehaus.plexus.classworlds.launcher.Launcher jetty:run").
                Then open tab MBeans and look for <b>org.glassfish.jersey</b> group. There you can find MBeans with
                statistics information about the deployed application. Go to for example to <b>Uris/resource/MethodTimes/attribues</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Make some requests</b> to the deployed application in order to modify statistics. These are available URIs:
