    <h1>Freemaker example</h1>
    <p>This example demonstrates how to use Freemarker templating engine to produce web pages via Jersey viewable support.</p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>
    <p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>URI path</th>
            <th>Resource class</th>
            <th>HTTP methods</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>/hello</td>
            <td>FreemarkerResource</td>
            <td>GET</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/autoTemplate</td>
            <td>FreemarkerResource</td>
            <td>GET</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/helloWithoutSuffix</td>
            <td>FreemarkerResource</td>
            <td>GET</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>See FreemarkerResource for details on how to use jersey-freemaker-webapp module for generating web pages.</p>
    <p>If you want to use freemarker in your project, don't forget to set <b>"jersey.config.freemarker.TemplateBasePath"</b> init param, which
    will be pointing to base directory where your templates are stored (FreemarkerTest class does that).</p>

    <h2>Running the Example</h2>
         <p>Run the tests of the example as follows:</p>
        <blockquote><pre>
mvn clean test</pre></blockquote>
        <p>This deploys this example using
            <a href="http://grizzly.java.net/">Grizzly</a> and executes the Jersey Test Framework using the unit test framework.
        </p>
        <p>You can see test classes at <code>src/main/test</code> subdirectory
         for detailed information how to consume the service using Client API.</p>
    <p>Run the example as follows:</p>
    <blockquote><pre>
mvn clean package jetty:run</pre></blockquote>
    <p>This deploys current example using Jetty. You can access the application at <a href="http://localhost:8080/freemarker-webapp/hello">http://localhost:8080/freemarker-webapp/hello</a>
