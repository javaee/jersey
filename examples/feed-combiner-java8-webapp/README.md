Feed Combiner WebApp Example
============================

Feed Combiner is an application that allows us to aggregate entries from
individual feeds and to provide a final combined result in several ways.
In order to download a given aggregated combined feed, we can use REST
API and consume the entry feeds in format, such as HTML, JSON and ATOM.
If it's easier for us to use a browser and sufficient to display the
settings of combined feeds, there is also a simple HTML page in which is
possible to manage our combined feeds.

The application provides two ways to manage it: REST API and WEB
Application

Contents
--------

The example consists of four web resources implemented by the following:

`org.glassfish.jersey.examples.feedcombiner.resource.CombinedFeedResource`
:   The combined feed resource that saves a new combined feed which
    automatically starts a scheduler for downloading new entries for
    provided feeds. Then it is also able to delete a particular feed and
    provide list of entries of the given feed in JSON or ATOM
    XML format.

`org.glassfish.jersey.examples.feedcombiner.resource.CombinedFeedController`
:   The combined feed controller provides GUI Manager using
    FreeMarker templates. It is possible to save, delete, and show a
    particular feed using HTML forms generated from templates.

The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:

  URI path                                         | Resource class           | HTTP methods   | Allowed values
 ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------
 **_/combiner/feeds_**                             | CombinerFeedResource     | POST           | returns JSON
 **_/combiner/feeds/{feed_id}_**                   | CombinerFeedResource     | DELETE         | N/A
 **_/combiner/feeds/{feed_id}/entries_**           | CombinerFeedResource     | GET            | returns JSON or ATOM\_XML
 **_/combiner_**                                   | CombinerFeedController   | GET            | FreeMarker templates/index.ftl
 **_/combiner_**                                   | CombinerFeedController   | POST           | FreeMarker templates/index.ftl
 **_/combiner/{feed_id}_**                         | CombinerFeedController   | GET            | FreeMarker templates/feed-entries.ftl
 **_/combiner/delete/{feed_id}?_method=DELETE_**   | CombinerFeedController   | POST           | FreeMarker templates/index.ftl

Sample Response
---------------

### Create a Combined Feed

-   URL: `http://localhost:8080/combiner/feeds`
-   Http-Method: `POST`
-   Content-Type: `application/json`

```javascript
{
    "title": "title",
    "description": "description",
    "refreshPeriod": 5,
    "urls": [
        "http://www.buzzfeed.com/index.xml",
        "http://www.reddit.com/r/java/.rss"
    ]
}
```

-   *refreshPeriod* is optional value, if it's `null`, the default value
    from `application.properties` will be used
-   At least one URL must be valid otherwise an error message will be
    returned

```javascript
{
    "messages":[
        "At least one valid URL must be in the request."
    ]
}
```

#### Response

-   Status Code: `201 Created`
-   Location: `http://localhost:8080/combiner/feeds/1`
-   Content-Type: `application/json`

```javascript
{
  "id":"1",
  "urls":[
    "http://www.buzzfeed.com/index.xml","http://www.reddit.com/r/java/.rss"
  ],
  "refreshPeriod":5,
  "feedEntries":[],
  "title":"title",
  "description":"description"
}
```

### Delete a Combined Feed

#### Request

-   URL: `http://localhost:8080/combiner/feeds/{feed_id}`
-   Http-Method: `DELETE`

#### Response

-   Status Code: `204 No Content`

### Get Combined Feed entries

#### Request

-   URL: `http://localhost:8080/combiner/feeds/{feed_id}/entries`
-   Http-Method: `GET`
-   Accept: `application/json` or `application/atom+xml`

#### Response

-   Status Code: `200 OK`
-   Body: Structured data depending on the `Accept` header in the
    request

Running the Example
-------------------

Run the example as follows:

>     mvn clean compile exec:java

This deploys the example using [Grizzly](http://grizzly.java.net/)

>     mvn clean package jetty:run

This deploys current example using Jetty. You can access the application
at

-   REST API: <http://localhost:8080/combiner/feeds>
-   GUI Manager: <http://localhost:8080/combiner>

Resources
---------

### This examples is using the following (3-rd party) libraries:

**ROME** by RomeTools

ROME includes a set of parsers and generators for the various flavors of
syndication feeds, as well as converters to convert from one format to
another. The parsers can give you back Java objects that are either
specific for the format you want to work with, or a generic normalized
SyndFeed class that lets you work on with the data without bothering
about the incoming or outgoing feed type.
