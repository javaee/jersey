        <h1>Managed Beans Example</h1>

        <p>This example demonstrates managed bean support in Jersey.
            JAX-RS root resource classes are annotated with @ManagedBean, which means EE-related
            resources may be injected into instances of those classes.
        </p>

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>The example application includes two root resource classes that are treated as Java EE managed beans.
            One root resource class is managed in the default JAX-RS life-cycle
            (one instance per request) and the other is managed in the
            singleton life-cycle (one instance per web application).
        </p><p>
            Two Java EE artifacts are injected into the singleton root resource.
            The first is a resource constant defined in the web.xml.
            The second is an entity manager factory to allow integration with JPA layer.</p>

        <h2>Running the Example</h2>

        <p>This sample utilizes Java EE features in GlassFish application server.</p>

        <p>The easiest way to get the application running is to build it and deploy as follows:
<pre>
mvn clean package
$AS_HOME/asadmin deploy target/managed-beans-webapp.war
</pre></p>
