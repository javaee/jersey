<h1>Message Streaming Jersey Example</h1>

<p>
    An example demonstrating how Server Sent Events (SSE) Jersey support can be used to create a message
    aggregating and streaming resource. The example also demonstrates how to consume data provided by a
    <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis">Twitter Streaming API</a> using Jersey
    <code>ChunkedInput</code> client-side support.
</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>
    The example consists of a Swing GUI client application and a server-side application deployed on
    a <a href="http://grizzly.java.net">Grizzly container</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The Swing client application opens in a single window split into multiple configuration panels. The top-left panel
    allows to select which aggregators should be executed. It is possible to select a twitter message aggregator and/or
    a fake test message aggregator.
    The panel below provides means for adding new keywords tracked by the Twitter message aggregator (if enabled).
    All actively tracked keywords are listed in the right-side list box which supports removal of the keys using a
    <code>Delete</code> key on your keyboard.
    The last panel in the Swing client window contains a Start/Stop button for starting or stopping the selected
    aggregators as well as a text area for displaying the messages that the aggregators have sent to the message aggregating
    resource deployed on the server-side of the application.
</p>

<p>
    The server side part of the application consists of a message aggregating JAX-RS resource and a simple HTML page that
    includes a browser SSE client written in Javascript as well as a basic CSS stylesheet.
    The SSE Javascript client connects to the JAX-RS message aggregating resource and transforms the streamed message
    data into HTML code that is rendered by the browser.
    The mapping of the URI path space of the server-side part of the application is presented in the following table:
</p>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>URI path</th>
        <th>Resource class</th>
        <th>HTTP methods</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><code>/aggregator-api/message/stream</code></td>
        <td><code>MessageStreamResource</code></td>
        <td><code>GET, PUT</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Application is programmatically configured to run on Grizzly container under base paths <code>aggregator</code>
    and <code>aggregator-api</code>.
</p>

<h2>Running the Example</h2>
<p>
    Before running the example, you need to copy the <code>twitter-api.properties</code> file available in the root
    directory of this example to your user home directory. Once done, you need to edit the file in your user home directory
    and provide a valid twitter account credentials. This step is necessary as the Twitter streaming API is protected
    using HTTP Basic Authentication mechanism and only an authenticated twitter account owner can access the API.
    The TwitterAggregator class in the example will use the credentials provided in the file to access the Twitter
    Streaming API.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have set up your Twitter credentials, you're ready to run the example. You can run the example by executing
    a main class via maven as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><code>mvn clean compile exec:java</code></blockquote>
<p>
    This deploys the current example as well as it starts the Swing client application.
    You should be able to see the main Swing application window open as you run the application as well
    as you should see the note in the command line stating that the Grizzly container has started and
    the server side part of the application has been deployed.
    After successful deployment, you should be able to access the browser SSE client page at
    <a href="http://localhost:8080/aggregator/index.html">http://localhost:8080/aggregator/index.html</a>.
    To see the raw SSE event stream, you may also point your browser directly at the
    <a href="http://localhost:8080/aggregator-api/message/stream"><code>MessageStreamResource</code></a>.
    Note that you first need to start the message aggregators via the Swing client application in order to
    be able to receive any SSE events from the message streaming resource.
