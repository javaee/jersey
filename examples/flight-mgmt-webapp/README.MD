Flight Management Web Application Example
=========================================

This example demonstrates various Jersey features, namely:

-   Jersey Test Framework
-   Monitoring and Tracing support
-   Bean Validation integration
-   Implementing custom security context provider & use of standard security annotations
-   Entity Filtering support
-   MVC Templates
-   SSE events; including a simple HTML5 animation based on data received from SSE events

Flight Management Web Application is a simple demo application for
managing (creating, updating, deleting, reserving) flights and aircrafts
and their subsequent animated flight simulation on HTML5 canvas using
streamed SSE data.

Contents
--------

The example consists of 3 main resource classes:

`org.glassfish.jersey.examples.flight.resources.AircraftsResource`

Resource exposing aircraft data (collections or individual
aircraft instances) as well as methods for manipulating the
aircraft data.

`org.glassfish.jersey.examples.flight.resources.FlightsResource`

Resource exposing flight data (collections or individual
flight instances) as well as methods for manipulating the
flight data.

`org.glassfish.jersey.examples.flight.resources.FlightSimResource`

Resource controlling the flight simulation lifecycle and exposing
SSE stream of simulation events (changes in flight locations).

All the application JAX-RS resources are deployed under the same `api`
root path. The mapping of the URI path space for the individual
resources is presented in the following table:

URI path                           | Resource class      | HTTP methods | Description
---------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**_/flights_**                     | FlightsResource     | GET          | Retrieve list of flights in various formats - XML, JSON, TXT, HTML, CSV, YAML
**_/flights_**                     | FlightsResource     | POST         | Create a new flight (input: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`; output: XML, JSON); Requires "admin" role.
**_/flights/open_**                | FlightsResource     | GET          | Retrieve list of open flights (not closed for simulation) - XML, JSON
**_/flights/{id}_**                | FlightsResource     | GET          | Retrieve detailed information about a single flight - XML, JSON, HTML
**_/flights/{id}_**                | FlightsResource     | DELETE       | Delete a single flight (output: deleted flight identifier - TXT); Requires "admin" role.
**_/flights/{id}/new-booking_**    | FlightsResource     | POST         | Reserve a seat in a flight. (output: reservation identifier - TXT, HTML)
**_/flights/{id}/status_**         | FlightsResource     | POST         | Change flight status. (input: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`; output: new status name - TXT); Requires "admin" role.
**_/aircrafts_**                   | AircraftsResource   | GET          | Retrieve list of aircrafts in various formats - XML, JSON, HTML
**_/aircrafts_**                   | AircraftsResource   | POST         | Create a new aircraft (input: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`; output: XML, JSON); Requires "admin" role.
**_/aircrafts/available_**         | AircraftsResource   | GET          | Retrieve list of available aircrafts (not assigned to a flight) - XML, JSON
**_/aircrafts/{id}_**              | AircraftsResource   | GET          | Retrieve detailed information about a single aircraft - XML, JSON, HTML
**_/aircrafts/{id}_**              | AircraftsResource   | DELETE       | Delete a single aircraft (output: deleted aircraft identifier - TXT); Requires "admin" role.
**_/simulation_**                  | FlightSimResource   | POST         | START/STOP simulation (input: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`; output: TXT)
**_/simulation/events_**           | FlightSimResource   | GET          | Receive simulation events as SSE stream.

Running the Example
-------------------

Flight Management Web Application Example is a web application (WAR)
that can be deployed to any Servlet 3.x container. By default, the
examples runs on Jetty using the Jetty Maven plugin. Before the example
is run, it must be built first:

>    mvn clean package

This command builds the example WAR and runs all the unit tests against
the example application.

Once the example is built, it can be run as follows:

>    mvn jetty:run

Links
-----

When the example is run using the Jetty Maven plugin as described above,
the example Web application gets deployed to the local host under port
`8080`. As mentioned earlier, the resources can be accessed directly
under common `api` root path. Here are a few links to directly access
some of the `HTTP GET` operations on the application resources:

-   <http://localhost:8080/api/flights>
-   <http://localhost:8080/api/flights/open>
-   <http://localhost:8080/api/aircrafts>
-   <http://localhost:8080/api/aircrafts/available>

The HTML application root to be accessed via browser is represented by
the application `index.html` page:

-   <http://localhost:8080/index.html>
