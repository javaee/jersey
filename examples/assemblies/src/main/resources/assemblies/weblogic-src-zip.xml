<assembly>
    <!--
     An assembly that produces an example project source zip bundle with
     the jersey dependencies in the original project pom.xml file transformed
     to the "provided" scope.
     The resulting zipped example project sources are thus able to build example
     binaries that are suitable for a deployment on containers which host Jersey
     runtime by default (e.g. GlassFish).
