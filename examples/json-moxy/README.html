<h1>MOXy JAX-RS JSON Provider Example</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates how to produce/consume JSON representations from Java objects.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>URI path</th>
        <th>Resource class</th>
        <th>HTTP methods</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>/test</td>
        <td>JsonResource</td>
        <td>GET</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>/test</td>
        <td>JsonResource</td>
        <td>POST</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>(See JsonResourceTest for more details.)</p>
