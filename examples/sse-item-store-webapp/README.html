<h1>SSE Item Store Jersey Example</h1>

<p>
    An example demonstrating how Server Sent Events (SSE) Jersey support can be used to notify clients about
    changes in server-side managed data (collection of items). The example also outlines how SSE events can
    be consumed using javascript browser-based clients.
</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>
    The example consists of a web-based client application and a server-side application deployed on
    a <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/">Jetty servlet container</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The server side part of the application consists of a JAX-RS resource managing collection of string items
    and a simple HTML page that includes a browser SSE client written in Javascript as well as a basic CSS stylesheet.
    The SSE Javascript client connects to the JAX-RS resource and transforms the streamed messages into HTML code
    that is rendered by the browser. The javascript client also demonstrates how named and unnamed SSE events are
    handled by HTML5 <code>EventSource</code> component.
    The mapping of the URI path space of the server-side part of the application is presented in the following table:
</p>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>URI path</th>
        <th>Resource class</th>
        <th>HTTP methods</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td><code>/resources/items</code></td>
        <td><code>ItemStoreResource</code></td>
        <td><code>GET, POST</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>/resources/items/events</code></td>
        <td><code>ItemStoreResource</code></td>
        <td><code>GET (SSE)</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Application is configured to run using Jetty maven plugin under base path <code>sse-item-store-webapp</code>.
</p>

<h2>Running the Example</h2>
<blockquote><code>mvn clean compile jetty:run</code></blockquote>
<p>
    The command above deploys the current example.
    After successful deployment, you should be able to access the browser SSE client page at
    <a href="http://localhost:8080/sse-item-store-webapp/index.html">http://localhost:8080/sse-item-store-webapp/index.html</a>.
    To see the raw SSE event stream, you may also point your browser directly at the
    <a href="http://localhost:8080/sse-item-store-webapp/resources/items/events"><code>ItemStoreResource</code></a>.
</p>

<h2>Deploying the example to another servlet container.</h2>
<blockquote><code>mvn clean package</code></blockquote>
<p>
    The command above creates a Servlet 3.x compliant WAR located in the target directory. The WAR can be then deployed to your
    Servlet 3.x compliant container.
</p>

<h2>Running Test Client</h2>
<p>After deploying the application into a Servlet 3.x compliant container, you can run the attached test by executing:</p>
<code>mvn test -Djersey.config.test.container.factory=org.glassfish.jersey.test.external.ExternalTestContainerFactory -Djersey.config.test.container.port=&lt;port&gt;</code>
