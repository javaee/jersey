  <body>
      <h1>OSGi HttpService Example</h1>

      <p>This example demonstrates how to develop a simple OSGi bundle registering
      a Jersey based RESTful web service as an <a href="http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/http/HttpService.html">OSGi HttpService</a></p>

      <h2>Contents</h2>
      <p>The example bundle (see the <tt>bundle</tt> module) consists of just one Jersey resource:</p>
      <dl>
          <dt><code>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.osgihttpservice.StatusResource</code></dt>
          <dd>that produces a textual response to an HTTP GET</dd>
      </dl>
    <p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
	<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<th>URI path</th>
	<th>Resource class</th>
	<th>HTTP methods</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>/status</td>
	<td>StatusResource</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>
	</table>

      <h2>Running the Example</h2>
      <p>To run the example, you would need to build the OSGi bundle in the <tt>bundle</tt> module
      and install it to an OSGi runtime (e.g. Apache Felix) together with other OSGi bundles.
      Look at the attached <tt>functional-test</tt> module for details on the programatical runtime configuration</p>
      To build the bundle jar file and run the tests, you can just launch
<pre>%mvn clean install
</pre>
