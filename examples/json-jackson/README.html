    <h1>Jackson JAX-RS JSON Provider Example</h1>
    <p>This example demonstrates how to produce/consume JSON representation from Java objects. This applies not only to JAXB beans, as shown at <tt>json-from-jaxb</tt> example
    but also to ordinary, un-annotated, POJOs
    <p>A simple web application is presented with three simple read-only resources: One is based on a simple un-annotated POJO, and could only provide JSON based representations.
        Besides of the pure JSON, it also produces a JSONP (JSON with padding, which allows you to overcome the cross domain problem) representation.
    The second web resource shows how to workaround the default Jersey JSON provider limitation regarding empty arrays in JAXB beans. For this resource, the JSON representation
    is produced by Jackson JAX-RS provider, while XML representation is generated by JAXB. The third resource depicts how Jackson and JAXB annotations could be mixed together
    within a single POJO.


    <h2>Contents</h2>
    <p>The "empty array" web resource is implemented by <code>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.jackson.EmptyArrayResource</code> class.
    The "non JAXB" web resource is implemented by <code>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.jackson.NonJaxbBeanResource</code> class.
    Both resources use the default Jackson mapper configuration to serialize JSON data out and depicts the corner cases, where
    the Jersey internal, StAX based, JSON processing can not be utilized.
    <p>The <code>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.jackson.CombinedAnnotationResource</code> class is used to show how JAXB and Jackson
    annotations could be combined together in one Java bean for JSON serialization.
    See the <code>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.jackson.MyObjectMapperProvider</code>
    class where Jackson specific options are used to set up the desired JSON serialization configuration.

    <p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
	<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<th>URI path</th>
	<th>Resource class</th>
	<th>HTTP methods</th>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/emptyArrayResource</td>
	<td>EmptyArrayResource</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/nonJAXBResource</td>
	<td>NonJaxbBeanResource</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/combinedAnnotations</td>
	<td>CombinedAnnotationResource</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>
    </table>

    <p>Please note the <code>JSONConfiguration.FEATURE_POJO_MAPPING</code>
    feature set with the init parameters in the example Main class.
    This feature enables the Jackson JAX-RS provider.
    It the feature would be set to false or was missing,
    the Jackson entity providers would not be utilized.

    <h2>Running the Example</h2>
         <p>Run the example as follows:</p>
        <blockquote><pre>
mvn clean compile exec:java</pre></blockquote>
        <p>This deploys the Jackson JSON provider example using
