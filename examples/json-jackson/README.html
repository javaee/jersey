<h1>Jackson JAX-RS JSON Provider Example</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates how to produce/consume JSON representations from Java objects. This applies not only to JAXB beans, as shown in the <tt>json-from-jaxb</tt> example
    but also to ordinary, un-annotated, POJOs.
<p>This example hosts three simple read-only resources: One provides an example of using a Jackson JSON provider (registered by the feature <code>JacksonFeature</code> in the <code>MyApplication</code> class)
    instead of using JAXB (Object->JAXB->JSON) which has some limitations (e.g. empty arrays in JAXB beans). For this resource the JSON representation is produced by the Jackson JAX-RS provider, while the XML representation is generated by JAXB as usual.
    The second web resource is based on a simple un-annotated POJO and provides only JSON-based representations: JSON and JSON with padding (JSONP).
    The third resource depicts how Jackson and JAXB annotations could be mixed together within a single POJO.


<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The "empty array" web resource is implemented by the <code>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.jackson.EmptyArrayResource</code> class.
    The "non JAXB" web resource is implemented by the <code>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.jackson.NonJaxbBeanResource</code> class.
    Both resources use the default Jackson mapper configuration to serialize JSON data out and depicts the corner cases, where
    the Jersey internal, StAX based, JSON processing can not be utilized.
<p>The <code>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.jackson.CombinedAnnotationResource</code> class is used to show how JAXB and Jackson
    annotations could be combined together in one Java bean for JSON serialization.
    See the <code>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.jackson.MyObjectMapperProvider</code>
    class where Jackson specific options are used to set up the desired JSON serialization configuration.

<p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>URI path</th>
        <th>Resource class</th>
        <th>HTTP methods</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>/emptyArrayResource</td>
        <td>EmptyArrayResource</td>
        <td>GET</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>/nonJaxbResource</td>
        <td>NonJaxbBeanResource</td>
        <td>GET</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>/combinedAnnotations</td>
        <td>CombinedAnnotationResource</td>
        <td>GET</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>To use Jackson specific configuration options, one can implement
    a <code>ContextResolver&lt;ObjectMapper&gt;</code> provider.
    For an example of such an implementation, see the <code>MyObjectMapperProvider</code> class.

<h2>Running the Example</h2>
<p>Run the example as follows:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
mvn clean compile exec:java</pre></blockquote>
<p>This deploys the example using
    <a href="http://grizzly.java.net/">Grizzly</a>
</p>
<p>A <a href="http://wadl.java.net/#spec">WADL description</a> may be accessed at the URL:</p>
<blockquote><code><a href="http://localhost:8080/jackson/application.wadl">http://localhost:8080/jackson/application.wadl</a></code></blockquote>

<p>The three resources are available at</p>
<blockquote><code><a href="http://localhost:8080/jackson/emptyArrayResource">http://localhost:8080/jackson/emptyArrayResource</a></code></blockquote>
<blockquote><code><a href="http://localhost:8080/jackson/nonJaxbResource">http://localhost:8080/jackson/nonJaxbResource</a></code></blockquote>
<blockquote><code><a href="http://localhost:8080/jackson/combinedAnnotations">http://localhost:8080/jackson/combinedAnnotations</a></code></blockquote>

<p>To easily obtain the different output types available, <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> can be used as follows:</p>

<p>Obtain the JSON output of EmptyArrayResource (use <code>-HAccept:application/xml</code> for XML output):</p>
<blockquote><pre>curl -HAccept:application/json http://localhost:8080/jackson/emptyArrayResource</pre></blockquote>

<p>Obtain the JSON output of NonJaxbBeanResource (use <code>-HAccept:application/javascript</code> for JSONP output):</p>
<blockquote><pre>curl -HAccept:application/json http://localhost:8080/jackson/nonJaxbResource</pre></blockquote>

<p>Obtain the JSON output of CombinedAnnotationResource:</p>
<blockquote><pre>curl -HAccept:application/json http://localhost:8080/jackson/combinedAnnotations</pre></blockquote>
