<h1>Extended WADL WebApp Example</h1>

<p>This example demonstrates how to get an extended WADL generated by jersey.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>The description of what's done here you'll find in the
    <a href="https://wikis.oracle.com/display/Jersey/HowToConfigureExtendedWADL">jersey 1 wiki</a>.</p>

<p>The difference in configuration against jersey 1.x is in property configuring the custom WadlGeneratorConfig. Instead of
    property
    key 'com.sun.jersey.config.property.WadlGeneratorConfig' use the property key 'jersey.config.server.wadl.generatorConfig'.
    Also check pom.xml of this sample to see other configuration differences.</p>.
<p>Just as a pointer at which files you might have a look:
<ul>
    <li>pom.xml</li>
    <li>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml</li>
    <li>src/main/resources/*</li>
    <li>src/main/xsd/schema.xsd</li>
    <li>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.extendedwadl.SampleWadlGeneratorConfig
</ul>

<p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
<table border="1">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>URI path</th>
        <th>Resource class</th>
        <th>HTTP method</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>items</td>
        <td>ItemsResource</td>
        <td>POST</td>
        <td>Creates a new item and allocates a new unique URI for it, the new URI is returned back in the Location header</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>items/{id}</td>
        <td>ItemResource</td>
        <td>GET</td>
        <td>Returns an item with the id={id}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>items/{id}/value/{val}</td>
        <td>ItemResource</td>
        <td>PUT</td>
        <td>Updates the value of the item with the id={id} with the new value {val}</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Running the Example</h2>

<p>If you are working with Jersey GlassFish update center module installed into your existing GlassFish instance,
    you will need to follow instructions at <a href="../../README.html">the module README file</a> in order to deploy the example.

<p>Otherwise, you can run the example using embedded GlassFish as follows:</p>

<p>You can run the example using Grizzly as follows:</p>
<blockquote><code>mvn clean package exec:java</code></blockquote>
<p>Get the generated wadl via curl:</p>
<blockquote><code>curl http://localhost:8080/extended-wadl-webapp/application.wadl</code></blockquote>
<p>Or from a web browser, visit:</p>
<blockquote><code><a href="http://localhost:8080/extended-wadl-webapp/application.wadl">http://localhost:8080/extended-wadl-webapp/application.wadl</a></code>
