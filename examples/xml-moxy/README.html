<h1>MOXy Example</h1>

<h2>What is MOXy</h2>
<p>This example demonstrates that you can utilize MOXy extensions when dealing with XML representation when developing a Jersey based RESTful Web application</p>

<p>MOXy is EclipseLink's Object to XML Mapping services. MOXy allows for a POJO object model to be mapped to an XML schema. The Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) provides a Java standard for object XML mapping (OXM). MOXy supports JAXB, as well as providing its' own native API and integration with Web Services.
</p>

<h2>MOXy XML Path Mapping Extension</h2>

<p>The MOXy extension shown in this example is described on the Eclipse Wiki site
    at <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Examples/MOXy/GettingStarted/MOXyExtensions">http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Examples/MOXy/GettingStarted/MOXyExtensions</a>.
    It allows you to specify path based mapping via @XmlPath annotation.
</p>

<p>If the MOXy extension was not used, the XML represenation of the customer data would look like follows:
      <pre>
&lt;customer&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Jane Doe&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;address&gt;
    &lt;city&gt;My Town&lt;/city&gt;
    &lt;street&gt;123 Any Street&lt;/street&gt;
  &lt;/address&gt;
  &lt;phoneNumbers type="work"&gt;613-555-1111&lt;/phoneNumbers&gt;
  &lt;phoneNumbers type="cell"&gt;613-555-2222&lt;/phoneNumbers&gt;
&lt;/customer&gt;
      </pre>
By adding <code>@org.eclipse.persistence.oxm.annotations.XmlPath</code> annotation to the bean definition classes,
you will get the following XML representation instead:
      <pre>
&lt;customer&gt;
  <b>&lt;personal-info&gt;</b>
    &lt;name&gt;Jane Doe&lt;/name&gt;
  <b>&lt;/personal-info&gt;
      &lt;contact-info&gt;</b>
    &lt;address&gt;
      &lt;city&gt;My Town&lt;/city&gt;
      &lt;street&gt;123 Any Street&lt;/street&gt;
    &lt;/address&gt;
    <b>&lt;phone-number type="work"&gt;</b>613-555-1111<b>&lt;/phone-number&gt;</b>
    <b>&lt;phone-number type="cell"&gt;</b>613-555-2222<b>&lt;/phone-number&gt;</b>
  <b>&lt;/contact-info&gt;</b>
&lt;/customer&gt;
      </pre>
XML Path expressions used are:
<ul>
    <li>personal-info/name/text()</li>
    <li>contact-info/address</li>
    <li>contact-info/phone-number</li>
</ul>
Please check out the source code and the wiki page linked above for the detailed information on the XML Path mapping feature.
</p>

<h2>Replacing Implicit JAXB Runtime With MOXy</h2>
<p>Since MOXy is a JAXB implementation, the example still utilizes the standard Jersey JAXB message body reader/writer providers.
    To make Jersey use MOXy runtime, you just need to put a <code>jaxb.properties</code> file into the Java package
    containing your JAXB beans. The file should have the following content:
<pre>
javax.xml.bind.context.factory=org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.JAXBContextFactory
</pre>
Concrete file used in this example is placed under <code>src/main/resources/com/sun/jersey/samples/moxy/beans/jaxb.properties</code>
</p>
<h2>REST Resources</h2>
<p>The example consists of a single REST Resource represented by the following Java class:</p>
<dl>
    <dt><code>com.sun.jersey.samples.moxy.CustomerResource</code></dt>
    <dd>A resource class that maintains a single customer data.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>URI path</th>
        <th>Resource class</th>
        <th>HTTP methods</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>/customer</td>
        <td>CustomerResource</td>
        <td>GET</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>/customer</td>
        <td>CustomerResource</td>
        <td>PUT</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Running the Example</h2>

<blockquote><code>mvn clean compile exec:java</code></blockquote>
<p>From a web browser, visit:</p>
<blockquote><code><a href="http://localhost:8080/xml-moxy/customer">http://localhost:8080/moxy/customer</a></code>
