Server-Sent Events (SSE) Example
================================

This example demonstrates JAX-RS 2.1 server-sent events support.

The full description how to add support for server-sent events to your application can be found in Jersey User Guide, 
chapter
[Server-Sent Events (SSE) Support](https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/sse.html).

Contents
--------

The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:

URI path                              | Resource class             | HTTP methods   | Description
------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------
**_server-sent-events_**              | ServerSentEventsResource   | GET            | Get entire EventOutput with all messages
**_server-sent-events_**              | ServerSentEventsResource   | POST           | Insert a new message in EventOutput
**_server-sent-events_**              | ServerSentEventsResource   | DELETE         | Reset EventOutput
**_server-sent-events/domains/{id}_** | BlockingPostChatResource   | POST           | Generate several messages with a delay in EventOutput and return it

Sample Response
---------------

A great example of Server-Sent Events is `server-sent-events/domains/{id}` which sends several messages with a delay 200ms
between each other.

>     curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/server-sent-events-jaxrs/domains/1 -H "Content-Type: text/event-stream"

Look at a console how events are handled one after another in the right order.

```
event: domain-progress
data: starting domain 1 ...

event: domain-progress
data: 50%

event: domain-progress
data: 60%

event: domain-progress
data: 70%

event: domain-progress
data: 99%

event: domain-progress
data: done
```

Running the Example
-------------------

Look at Jersey Documentation to learn how to consume Server-Sent Events using Jersey Client
<https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/sse.html#d0e11786>

Run the example as follows:

>     mvn clean compile exec:java

This deploys the example using [Grizzly](http://grizzly.java.net/) container.
