ambiguous.parameter=Parameter {1} of {0} MUST be only one of a path, query, matrix or header parameter.
ambiguous.resource.method="Multiple methods found to suit client request with accept header {0}. Selected the first method from the following list.
ambiguous.rms.in=A resource, {0}, has ambiguous (sub-)resource method for HTTP method {1} and input mime-types as defined by @Consumes annotation at Java methods {2} and {3}. This could cause an error for conflicting output types!
ambiguous.rms.out=A resource, {0}, has ambiguous (sub-)resource method for HTTP method {1} and output mime-types as defined by @Produces annotation at Java methods {2} and {3}.
