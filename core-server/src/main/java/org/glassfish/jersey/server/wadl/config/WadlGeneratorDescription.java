/**
 * This is the model for the definition of wadl generators via configuration properties.<br />
 * The properties refer to the properties of the {@link WadlGenerator} implementation with
 * the specified {@link WadlGeneratorDescription#getGeneratorClass()}. The {@link WadlGenerator} properties
 * are populated with the provided properties like this:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The types match exactly:<br/>if the WadlGenerator property is of type <code>org.example.Foo</code> and the
 * provided property value is of type <code>org.example.Foo</code></li>
 * <li>Types that provide a constructor for the provided type (mostly java.lang.String)</li>
 * <li>The WadlGenerator property is of type {@link InputStream}: The stream is loaded from the
 * property value (provided by the {@link WadlGeneratorDescription}) via
 * {@link ClassLoader#getResourceAsStream(String)}. It will be closed after {@link WadlGenerator#init()} was called.
 * </li>
 *
 * <li><strong>Deprecated, will be removed in future versions:</strong><br/>
 * The WadlGenerator property is of type {@link File} and the provided property value is a {@link String}:<br/>
 * the provided property value can contain the prefix <em>classpath:</em> to denote, that the
 * path to the file is relative to the classpath. In this case, the property value is stripped by
 * the prefix <em>classpath:</em> and the {@link File} is created via
 * <pre><code>new File( generator.getClass().getResource( strippedFilename ).toURI() )</code></pre>
 * Notice that the filename is loaded from the classpath in this case, e.g. <em>classpath:test.xml</em>
 * refers to a file in the package of the class ({@link WadlGeneratorDescription#getGeneratorClass()}). The
 * file reference <em>classpath:/test.xml</em> refers to a file that is in the root of the classpath.
 * </li>
 *
 * </ul>
