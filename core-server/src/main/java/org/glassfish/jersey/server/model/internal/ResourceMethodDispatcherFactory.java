/**
 * A resource method dispatcher provider factory.
 * <p>
 * This class is used by {@link org.glassfish.jersey.server.model.ResourceMethodInvoker} to
 * create a {@link org.glassfish.jersey.server.spi.internal.ResourceMethodDispatcher.Provider} instance
 * that will be used to provide a {@link org.glassfish.jersey.server.spi.internal.ResourceMethodDispatcher}
 * instances for all resource method invocations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * JAX-RS resource methods are invoked by {@link org.glassfish.jersey.server.model.ResourceMethodInvoker
 * resource method invoker}. Whenever a new incoming request has been routed to a resource method and the
 * method is being invoked by the resource method invoker, the invoker consults a registered
 * {@link org.glassfish.jersey.server.spi.internal.ResourceMethodDispatcher.Provider} instance to retrieve
 * a {@link org.glassfish.jersey.server.spi.internal.ResourceMethodDispatcher} that will be ultimately used
 * to dispatch the resource method invocation. This mechanism is useful for implementing any resource method
 * interception logic.
