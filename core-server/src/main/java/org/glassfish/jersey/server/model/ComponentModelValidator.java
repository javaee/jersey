/**
 * A resource model validator that checks the given resource model.
 *
 * This base resource model validator class implements the visitor pattern to
 * traverse through all the {@link ResourceModelComponent resource model components}
 * to check validity of a resource model.
 * <p />
 * This validator maintains a list of all the {@link ResourceModelIssue issues}
 * found in the model. That way all the resource model components can be validated
 * in a single call to the {@link #validate(ResourceModelComponent) validate(...)}
 * method and collect all the validation issues from the model.
 * <p />
 * To check a single resource class, the the {@link Resource}
 * {@code builder(...)} can be used to create a resource model.
 *
 * {@link ComponentModelValidator#validate(ResourceModelComponent)}
 * method then populates the issue list, which could be then obtained by the
 * {@link ComponentModelValidator#getIssueList()}. Unless the list is explicitly cleared,
 * a subsequent calls to the validate method will add new items to the list,
 * so that it can be used to build the issue list for more than one resource. To clear the
 * list, the {@link ComponentModelValidator#cleanIssueList()} method should be called.
 * <p />
