 * Monitoring statistics an of an execution of the resource method. The {@link #snapshot()}

 * <p/>
 * Statistics contain two {@link ExecutionStatistics} where {@link #getMethodStatistics()} contains
 * statistics for execution of the code of resource method and {@link #getRequestStatistics()} contains
 * statistics for complete processing of requests that were matched to the resource method. This implies that
 * {@link #getRequestStatistics()} will tend to contain higher time measurements as they measure total request
 * processing time and not only execution of the resource method.
 * <p/>
 * Statistics retrieved from Jersey runtime might be mutable and thanks to it might provide inconsistent data
 * as not all statistics are updated in the same time. To retrieve the immutable and consistent
 * statistics data the method {@link #snapshot()} should be used.
