/**
 * Proxiable wrapper for request scoped {@link SecurityContext} instance.
 *
 * <p>
 * This wrapper must be used and cannot be replaced by {@link org.glassfish.jersey.internal.inject.ReferencingFactory}.
 * The reason is that {@link SecurityContext security context} can be set
 * many times during the request processing. However, the HK2 proxy caches
 * the first value that is injected. So, if for example any filter injects
 * security context, then this security context will be cached and it will
 * never be replaced for the same request. On the other hand, HK2 should
 * probably cache the first value returned in the request scope to prevent
 * that two subsequent calls done on the proxy will be forwarded to different
 * object if the the object changes in the meantime.
