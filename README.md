## Jersey is Contributed to Eclipse Foundation

As you likely have noticed, Oracle is in the process of transitioning Java EE and related projects to the Eclipse Foundation [1]. Jersey is included in this list of projects and we are pleased to announce that the initial contribution has taken place. Jersey is being contributed to Eclipse Foundation as Eclipse Jersey[2].

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our community members for their effort and dedication to Jersey for these many years. Thank you for your many contributions and assistance improving the quality of the project, the documentation, and identifying issues.

We intend to transition this Jersey project repository to Archive status -- which will render it "Read Only." All issues will be migrated to the Eclipse Jersey project. All pending PRs will be closed. Any remaining PRs that are still relevant will be migrated to the new Eclipse Jersey project repository at GitHub [3].

We hope that you will join us as we continue evolving the new Eclipse Jersey project. Jersey will use the Eclipse developer mailing list for product announcements and updates [4]. If you want to track issues, don't forget to follow Eclipse Jersey at it's new GitHub location. The new process for contributions under Eclipse is described  under "Contributing file" at this link [5].

We look forward to your continued contributions as part of the Eclipse Foundation. We hope that this transition is easy and smooth.

Thank you again for making Jersey the best that it can be.
