/**
 * Basic application deployment context.

 * An instance of this class is created by creating using {@link Builder}, that allows to configure the deployment
 * context state, and finally building the context by invoking the {@link Builder#build()} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This deployment context is compatible with basic non-Servlet test containers. The following test container
 * factories support the descriptor:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code org.glassfish.jersey.test.grizzly.GrizzlyTestContainerFactory} for testing with the Grizzly HTTP container.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.glassfish.jersey.test.jetty.JettyTestContainerFactory} for testing with the Jetty HTTP container.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.glassfish.jersey.test.simple.SimpleTestContainerFactory} for testing with the Simple HTTP container.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.glassfish.jersey.test.jdkhttp.JdkHttpServerTestContainerFactory} for testing with the Light Weight HTTP
 * server distributed with Java SE.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.glassfish.jersey.test.inmemory.InMemoryTestContainerFactory} for testing in memory without
 * using underlying HTTP client and server side functionality to send requests and receive responses.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.glassfish.jersey.test.external.ExternalTestContainerFactory} for testing Java EE Web
 * applications deployed independently in a separate JVM to that of the tests. For example, the application
 * may be deployed to the GlassFish or WebLogic application server.</li>
