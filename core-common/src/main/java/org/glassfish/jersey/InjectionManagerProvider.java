/**
 * Utility class with static methods that extract {@link InjectionManager injection manager}
 * from various JAX-RS components. This class can be used when no injection is possible by
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.core.Context} or {@link javax.inject.Inject} annotation due to character of
 * provider but there is a need to get any service from {@link InjectionManager}.
 * <p>
 * Injections are not possible for example when a provider is registered as an instance on the client.
 * In this case the runtime will not inject the instance as this instance might be used in other client
 * runtimes too.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example. This is the class using a standard injection:
 * <pre>
 *     public static class MyWriterInterceptor implements WriterInterceptor {
 *         &#64;Inject
 *         MyInjectedService service;
 *
 *         &#64;Override
 *         public void aroundWriteTo(WriterInterceptorContext context) throws IOException, WebApplicationException {
 *             Something something = service.getSomething();
 *             ...
 *         }
 *
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If this injection is not possible then this construct can be used:
 * <pre>
 *     public static class MyWriterInterceptor implements WriterInterceptor {
 *
 *         &#64;Override
 *         public void aroundWriteTo(WriterInterceptorContext context) throws IOException, WebApplicationException {
 *             InjectionManager injectionManager = InjectionManagerProvider.getInjectionManager(context);
 *             MyInjectedService service = injectionManager.getInstance(MyInjectedService.class);
 *             Something something = service.getSomething();
 *             ...
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note, that this injection support is intended mostly for injection of custom user types. JAX-RS types
 * are usually available without need for injections in method parameters. However, when injection of custom
 * type is needed it is preferred to use standard injections if it is possible rather than injection support
 * provided by this class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * User returned {@code InjectionManager} only for purpose of getting services (do not change the state of the injection manager).
 * </p>
