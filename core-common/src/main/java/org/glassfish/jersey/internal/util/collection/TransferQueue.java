/**
 * A {@link BlockingQueue} in which producers may wait for consumers
 * to receive elements.  A {@code TransferQueue} may be useful for
 * example in message passing applications in which producers
 * sometimes (using method {@code transfer}) await receipt of
 * elements by consumers invoking {@code take} or {@code poll},
 * while at other times enqueue elements (via method {@code put})
 * without waiting for receipt. Non-blocking and time-out versions of
 * {@code tryTransfer} are also available.  A TransferQueue may also
 * be queried via {@code hasWaitingConsumer} whether there are any
 * threads waiting for items, which is a converse analogy to a
 * {@code peek} operation.
 *
 * <p>Like any {@code BlockingQueue}, a {@code TransferQueue} may be
 * capacity bounded. If so, an attempted {@code transfer} operation
 * may initially block waiting for available space, and/or
 * subsequently block waiting for reception by a consumer.  Note that
 * in a queue with zero capacity, such as {@link SynchronousQueue},
 * {@code put} and {@code transfer} are effectively synonymous.
