/**
 * {@link Qualifier Qualifier annotation} used to annotate HK2 injections and
 * bindings for user custom providers. Providers are classes which implement one
 * of the provider interfaces (for example {@link javax.ws.rs.ext.MessageBodyReader
 * Message body reader interface}).
 * <p>
 * Custom providers are bound in the HK2 injection manager using {@code &#64;Custom}
 * annotation. Once bound, the custom providers can be injected using {@code &#64;Custom}
 * qualifier annotation again.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 *  &#064;Inject
 *  &#064;Custom
 *  MessageBodyReader messageBodyReader;
 * </pre>
