 * Used to annotate SPI provider contracts recognized by Jersey (in addition to the JAX-RS providers).
 *
 * All proprietary Jersey extension APIs are annotated with the {@code &#064;Contract} annotation.
 * <p>
 * Similarly, any custom (i.e. not JAX-RS or Jersey) extension provider contract must be annotated with this
 * annotation otherwise concrete service classes implementing the provider contract would not be recognized
 * and treated as extension service provider by Jersey runtime.
