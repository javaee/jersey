import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;

/**
 * An extension contract for providing pluggable scheduled executor service providers to be used by
 * Jersey client or server runtime whenever a specific scheduler is needed to schedule execution of a
 * Jersey runtime processing task.
 * <p>
 * This mechanism allows Jersey to run in environments that have specific thread management and provisioning requirements,
 * such as application servers, cloud environments etc.
 * Dedicated Jersey extension modules or applications running in such environment may provide a custom
 * implementation of the {@code ScheduledExecutorServiceProvider} interface to customize the default
 * Jersey runtime thread management & provisioning strategy in order to comply with the threading requirements,
 * models and policies specific to each particular environment.
 * </p>
 * Jersey runtime expects that a concrete scheduled executor service provider implementation class is annotated with a
 * {@link javax.inject.Qualifier qualifier} annotation. This qualifier is then used to createAndInitialize a qualified injection point
 * for injecting the scheduled executor service instance provided by the annotated provider. {@link javax.inject.Named Named}
 * providers are also supported. For example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Named("my-scheduler")
 * public MySchedulerProvider implements ScheduledExecutorServiceProvider {
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // Injecting ScheduledExecutorService provided by the MySchedulerProvider
 * &#64;Inject &#64;Named("my-scheduler") ScheduledExecutorService myScheduler;
 * </pre>
