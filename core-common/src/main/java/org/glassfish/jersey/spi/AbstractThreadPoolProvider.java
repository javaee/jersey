/**
 * Abstract thread pool executor provider.
 * <p>
 * This class provides a skeleton implementation for provisioning and basic lifecycle management of thread pool executors.
 * Every instance of the concrete implementation of this provider class creates at most one shared and lazily initialized
 * thread pool executor instance, which can be retrieved by invoking the {@link #getExecutor()} method. This provider also makes
 * sure that the provisioned thread pool executor instance is properly shut down when the managing provider instance is
 * {@link #close() closed} (in case it has not been already shut down).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * At minimum, concrete subclasses of this provider are expected to implement the {@link #createExecutor} method that is used
 * as a thread pool instance factory. The method is invoked lazily, with the first call to the {@code getExecutor()} method.
 * The result returned from the {@code createExecutor()} method is cached internally and is used as a return value for subsequent
 * calls to the {@code getExecutor()} method. This means, that {@code createExecutor()} method is guaranteed to be invoked
 * <em>at most once</em> during the lifetime of any particular provider instance.
 * </p>
