/**
 * Linear acceptor that can be composed into a chain.
 *
 * The acceptor exposes a method for setting a value of the
 * {@link #setDefaultNext(Stage) next acceptor} in the chain that
 * should be returned from the chain by default.
 * <p>
 * The typical use case for implementing the acceptor is a logic that usually
 * needs to perform some logic, but unlike an {@link Stage.Builder#to(Function)}
 * acceptor created from a function} it also needs to be able to decide to override
 * the default next acceptor and return a different acceptor, effectively branching
 * away from the original linear acceptor chain. This technique can be e.g. used
 * to break the accepting chain by returning a custom {@link Inflecting inflecting}
 * acceptor, etc.
