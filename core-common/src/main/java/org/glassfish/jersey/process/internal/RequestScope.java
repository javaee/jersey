/**
 * Scopes a single request/response processing execution on a single thread.
 * <p>
 * To execute a code inside of the request scope use one of the {@code runInScope(...)}
 * methods and supply the task encapsulating the code that should be executed in the scope.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Inject
 * RequestScope requestScope;
 *
 * ...
 *
 * requestScope.runInScope(new Runnable() {
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public void run() {
 *          System.out.println("This is executed in the request scope...");
 *     }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * An instance of the request scope can be suspended and retrieved via a call to
 * {@link RequestScope#suspendCurrent} method. This instance can be later
 * used to resume the same request scope and run another task in the same scope:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *  Instance requestScopeInstance =
 *      requestScope.runInScope(new Callable&lt;Instance&gt;() {
 *          &#064;Override
 *          public Instance call() {
 *              // This is executed in the new request scope.
 *
 *              // The following call will cause that the
 *              // RequestScope.Instance will not be released
 *              // automatically and we will have to release
 *              // it explicitly at the end.
 *              return requestScope.suspendCurrent();
 *          }
 *      });
 *
 *  requestScope.runInScope(requestScopeInstance, new Runnable() {
 *
 *      &#064;Override
 *      public void run() {
 *          // This is executed in the same request scope as code above.
 *      }
 *  });
 *
 *  // The scope instance must be explicitly released.
 *  requestScopeInstance.release();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In the previous example the {@link RequestScope.Instance request scope instance}
 * was suspended and retrieved which also informs {@code requestScope} that it
 * should not automatically release the instance once the running task is finished.
 * The {@code requestScopeInstance} is then used to initialize the next
 * request-scoped execution. The second task will run in the same request scope as the
 * first task. At the end the suspended {@code requestScopeInstance} must be
 * manually {@link RequestScope.Instance#release released}. Not releasing the instance
 * could cause memory leaks. Please note that calling {@link RequestScope#suspendCurrent}
 * does not retrieve an immutable snapshot of the current request scope but
 * a live reference to the internal {@link RequestScope.Instance request scope instance}
 * which may change it's state during each request-scoped task execution for
 * which this scope instance is used.
 * </p>
