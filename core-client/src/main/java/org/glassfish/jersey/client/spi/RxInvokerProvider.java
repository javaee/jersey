 * Client-provider interface for creating {@link javax.ws.rs.client.RxInvoker reactive invoker} instances.

 * If supported by the provider, an invoker instance of the requested Java type will be created.

 * A provider shall support a one-to-one mapping between a type, provided the type is not {@link Object}. A provider may also
 * support mapping of sub-types of a type (provided the type is not {@code Object}). It is expected that each provider supports
 * mapping for distinct set of types and subtypes so that different providers do not conflict with each other.

 * {@code org.glassfish.jersey.client.spi.RxInvokerProvider} - in the resource directory {@code META-INF/services}, and adding
 * the fully qualified service-provider-class of the implementation in the file.
