/**
 * Chunk data parser.

 * Implementations of this interface are used by a {@link org.glassfish.jersey.client.ChunkedInput}
 * instance for parsing response entity input stream into chunks.
 * <p>
 * Chunk parsers are expected to read data from the response entity input stream
 * until a non-empty data chunk is fully read and then return the chunk data back
 * to the {@link org.glassfish.jersey.client.ChunkedInput} instance for further
 * processing (i.e. conversion into a specific Java type).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Chunk parsers are typically expected to skip any empty chunks (the chunks that do
 * not contain any data) or any control meta-data associated with chunks, however it
 * is not a hard requirement to do so. The decision depends on the knowledge of which
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.ext.MessageBodyReader} implementation is selected for de-serialization
 * of the chunk data.
